# Email_spam_classification
📧 Spam Email Classification

This project is a Machine Learning-based Spam Email Classifier that detects whether an email is Spam or Not Spam. The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction, followed by ML algorithms for classification. The project is deployed with Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface.

🚀 Features

Cleans and preprocesses email text (stopword removal, stemming, punctuation removal).

Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization.

Trains multiple ML models (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.).

Provides an easy-to-use Streamlit app for live predictions.

High accuracy on test dataset.
