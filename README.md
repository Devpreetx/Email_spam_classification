This project is a Machine Learning-based web application developed using Streamlit. It classifies whether an email is Spam or Not Spam based on the content provided. With a clean and interactive UI, users can input email text and instantly see the prediction in real-time.

## 🔍 Key Points

- **Spam Detection with NLP**  
  Predicts whether an email is Spam or Not Spam using Natural Language Processing techniques.

- **Interactive Web Interface with Streamlit**  
   Provides a simple, user-friendly interface where users can paste or type email text and get predictions—no coding required.

- **Machine Learning Model Integration**  
   Trained with models like Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest. The best-performing model is deployed for high accuracy.

- **Real-Time Predictions**  
    The app instantly processes text and returns results, ensuring fast and reliable spam detection.

- **Deployment Ready**  
  Easily deployable via Streamlit Community Cloud, GitHub, or any Python-compatible cloud platform.

  ### ✅ Features Used

  The following NLP and preprocessing techniques were used to train the spam classifier model:

- **Tokenization** – Breaking email text into words.
- **Stopword Removal** – Removing irrelevant/common words (e.g., the, is, at).  
- **Stemming** – Reducing words to their root form (e.g., running → run).  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** – Converting text into numerical feature vectors.
These steps help the model identify patterns in text that differentiate Spam emails from Non-Spam emails.

  ### ✅ Model Training Overview

- **Naive Bayes Classifier**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Gradient Boosting**

The best-performing model (based on accuracy & F1 score) was saved as spam_classifier_model.pkl and tfidf_vectorizer.pkl using Joblib for future use in prediction without retraining.

🚀 **Streamlit Web App**  
You can run the Streamlit frontend using the command:  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
